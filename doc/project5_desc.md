### GR5243 Spring 2022 Applied Data Science
### Project 5 Free-Topic Final Project

In this project, working in teams, you will implement, evaluate and **compare** algorithms for **Machine Learning Fairness**.

### Challenge
Project 5 will be our final project in this course.

It will be **free-topic project** meaning that you can choose any topic and data science tools to work on. There will be final presentations and instructor review. You can form teams of 1-5 students on your own. The minimum team size allowed is 3 and the maximum team size allowed is 6(exceptions can be granted with instructor's approval). 

#### Evaluation criteria 

- (7pts) Readabiity and reproducibility of codes
- (7pts) Validity of evaluation (well-defined measures of performance; experiment set up)
- (6pts) Presentation (report, github and in-class presentation)

*(More details will be posted as grading rubrics in courseoworks/canvas)*

### Working together
- Setup a GitHub project folder from joining the GitHub classroom link with everyone listed as contributors. Everyone clones the project locally via your GitHub desktop and create a local branch. 
- The team can work in subgroups of 2-3, which might meet more frequently than the entire team. However, everyone should check in regularly on group discussion online and changes in the GitHub folder.
- Learn to work together is an important learning goal of this course.
